# Works of Design and Analysis of Algorithms:

### Sort Order 01
Implementation of sort algorithms:
  - 1. Selection sort
  - 2. Insertion sort
  - 3. Merge sort
  - 4. Quicksort
  - 5. Heap Sort
  
  

### Building for source Order 01
  ```sh
  make all
   ```
  ```sh
   ./apa-first_job <method_number> < <input_file_name>
  ```
  
  
### Sort Order 02
  Given the implementations of work ordering 01 and the input sets provided for this exercise:

Select a colleague who has implemented sorting algorithms using a different programming language than yours.
For each input subset, run all algorithms and calculate the average time each algorithm spends for each size present in the subset.

### Building for source Order 02
  ```sh
  make all
   ```
  ```sh
   scriptBuildAll.sh
  ```
  
### Sort Order 03
Implementation of sort algorithms:
  - 6. Counting sort 
  - 7. Bucket sort
  - 8. Radix sort
 
  

### Building for source Order 03
  ```sh
  make all
   ```
  ```sh
   ./apa-first_job <method_number> < <input_file_name>
  ```
